            <ol>
                <li>Take all your fresh vegetables and cut into 
                    like sized pieces</li>
                <li>Now take your chicken, and do the same! Before 
                you do this, start heating up your skillet on a 
                medium-high heat!</li>
                <li>Once the skillet is hot, put olive oil in and 
                    let heat up. Throw chicken in and cook for 4-5
                    minutes. Don't cook through yet, chicken will 
                    continue cooking as you cook your veg.</li>
                <li>Next add the frozen green beans, after 2-3 
                    minutes then add red onion.</li> 
                <li>Then add your bell pepper, squash, and zucchini.</li> 
                <li>After all of this has cooked down, turn heat off
                    and add your desired amount of pesto and mix in.</li>
                <li>That is it, you've made a simple yet filling dish.
                    You can add a side of pasta or whatever tickles your 
                    fancy, go wild</li>
